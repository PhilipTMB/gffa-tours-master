    <h1>Recylopedia</h1>
    <h2>All About Recycling</h2>
        <section class="row">
          <p>We probably all know your basic recyclables: Aluminum, paper, glass, cardboard, et cetera. However, there’s actually a lot more that’s recycling-friendly than you’re taught as kids. Here are some safe options. (but that still doesn’t mean it’s okay to recycle your garbage.) </p>

          <p>#1- Aluminum: Soda cans, bakeware, and steel or tin soup cans.</p>

          <p>#2- Plastics: All plastics are recyclable (please just clean them out first)</p>

          <p>#3- Glass: Clear, green and brown glass.</p>

          <p>#4- Batteries: Car batteries, household and button batteries, and rechargeable batteries.</p>

          <p>#5-  Light Bulbs: Incandescent, LED, and compact fluorescent bulbs.</p>

          <p>#6- Technology: Old computers, cell phones, home phones, stereos, printers and fax machines, and TVs are recyclable too!</p>








          <h1>These are some trash items that are commonly mistaken for recyclables. Please avoid recycling them!</h1>

          <p>#1 – Styrofoam: Avoid using Styrofoam products whenever possible including cups, disposable plates and packing materials. These items are notoriously bad for the landfills and for our environment.</p>

          <p>#2 – Plastic Lids: While some water bottle lids are now made of recyclable materials, the small plastic lids that you find on top of soda pop bottles, water bottles and other recyclable items are made of a completely different materials than the bottles themselves and have a different melting point.
</p>

          <p>#5 – Food-Contaminated Containers: This includes pizza boxes, carry-out food containers – anything that has come in contact with food. The grease and oil that are found in these foods can contaminate the entire recycling process.
</p>

          <p>#7 – Tires: When melted tires emit a toxic gas that is dangerous to humans and the environment. Your best bet is to re-purpose tires because they just won’t break down like other materials.</p>
